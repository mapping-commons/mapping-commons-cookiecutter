# Getting started

### Step 1: Create a virtual environment
First, create a virtual environment of your choice (anaconda, venv, pyenv, poetry etc.). If you need assistance with virtual environments, [here's a guide](https://berkeleybop.github.io/best_practice/python_environments) to help you setup pyenv and use poetry with it.

### Step 2: Install cruft in your virtual environment
Install the [cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft) package. Cruft enables keeping projects up-to-date with future updates made to this original template.

```
pip install cruft
```

### Step 3: Use cruft to create your Mapping Commons project
In your virtual environment, create a project using the [mapping-commons-cookiecutter](https://github.com/mapping-commons/mapping-commons-cookiecutter) template.

```
cruft create https://github.com/mapping-commons/mapping-commons-cookiecutter
```

This kickstarts an interactive session where you declare the following:
- `project_name`: Name of the project. [defaults to: my-commons-name]
- `project_description`: Description of the project [defaults to: 'This is the project description.']
- `github_or_gitlab`: Choose from [1]: github, [2]: gitlab
- `git_org`: Name of the github (or gitlab) org the project belongs to. [defaults to: my-org]
- `full_name`: Name of the author [defaults to: 'My Name']
- `email`: Author's email [defaults to: 'my-name@my-org.org']
- `license`: Choose from [1]: Yes, [2]: No [**TEST OPTION FOR NOW**]

### Step 4: Create a GitHub/GitLab project

#### GitHub

1. Go to [https://github.com/new] and follow the instructions, being sure to
   NOT add a README or .gitignore file (this cookiecutter template will take
   care of this for you).

2. In a terminal, change to the folder your generated project is in and initialize git for the project.

   ```bash
   cd my-commons-name
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Initial commit' -a
   ```

3. Follow the instructions to 'add the remote to your local git repository'.

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/my-user-or-organization/my-commons-name.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

#### GitLab

1. Go to [https://gitlab.com/projects/new#blank_project] and follow the instructions, being sure to
   NOT add a README file (this cookiecutter template will take
   care of this for you).

2. In a terminal, change to the folder your generated project is in and follow the instructions to 'push an existing folder'.

   ```bash
   cd my-commons-name
   git init --initial-branch=main
   git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/my-user-or-organization/my-commons-name.git
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Initial commit'
   git push -set-upstream origin main
   ```

# What does this do?

The following files and directories are autogenerated in the project:

This section is under development. If you have questions about this in the meantime, reach out on https://github.com/mapping-commons/mapping-commons-cookiecutter/issues.


# Future updates to the project's boilerplate code

In order to be up-to-date with the template, first check if there is a mismatch between the project's boilerplate code and the template by running:
```
cruft check
```

This indicates if there is a difference between the current project's boilerplate code and the latest version of the project template. If the project is up-to-date with the template:
```
SUCCESS: Good work! Project's cruft is up to date and as clean as possible :).
```

Otherwise, it will indicate that the project's boilerplate code is not up-to-date by the following:
```
FAILURE: Project's cruft is out of date! Run `cruft update` to clean this mess up.
```

For viewing the difference, run `cruft diff`. This shows the difference between the project's boilerplate code and the template's latest version.

After running `cruft update`, the project's boilerplate code will be updated to the latest version of the template.

### Make changes to the template variable values used to create the project

#### TODO

* Edit the values in [config/project-cruft.json](config/project-cruft.json).
* Run:
    ```bash
    sh odk.sh make update-variables
    ```
